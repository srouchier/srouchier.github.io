Cracks and defects in construction materials can cause an increase in their moisture
permeability, and accentuate their degradation. In order to accurately assess the dura-
bility and the overall performance of building facades, one must dispose of a reliable
method for the identification of the damage state of such materials. The present work
aims at developing a methodology for the detection and monitoring of damage and
fractures in building materials. Digital image correlation and acoustic emission moni-
toring were simultaneously performed during tensile loading tests of fibre-reinforced
mortar samples. The optical technique was found able to reveal all ranges of cracks,
from microscopic to macroscopic, and an image-processing procedure was conducted
as to quantify their evolution in the course of the degradation of the samples. It was
also found that the acoustic activity could be related to the optical measurements in
terms of damage quantification and localisation.
