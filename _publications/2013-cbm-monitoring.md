The present work aims at developing a methodology for the detection and monitoring of damage and fractures in building materials in the prospects of energetic renovation. Digital image correlation (DIC) and acoustic emission (AE) monitoring were simultaneously performed during tensile loading tests of fibre reinforced mortar samples. The full-field displacement mappings obtained by DIC revealed all ranges of cracks, from microscopic to macroscopic, and an image processing procedure was conducted as to quantify their evolution in the course of the degradation of the samples. The comparison of these measurements with the acoustic activity of the material showed a fair match in terms of quantification and localisation of damage. It is shown that after such a calibration procedure, AE monitoring can be autonomously used for the characterisation of damage and fractures at larger scales.
