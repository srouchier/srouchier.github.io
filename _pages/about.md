I am an assistant professor at the Université Savoie Mont-Blanc (Chambéry, France).

My primary academic interest is to use fancy data analysis techniques to evaluate and improve the energy efficiency of buildings. Some applications are:
* Evaluating the energy performance of buildings using in-situ measurements.
* Optimizing refurbishment solutions regarding cost, comfort and energy demand.
* Designing natural cooling strategies to make buildings and cities resilient to overheating.

I try to tackle some challenging inverse problems of building energy simulation by applying time series analysis techniques, state-space models and eventually Gaussian processes. My focus is on Bayesian inference methods for parameter estimation, and meta-heuristic methods for optimization. I mostly rely on the Python and Modelica languages, and the EnergyPlus software for building energy simulation. I also have a strong interest in GIS data analysis, although it is not yet apparent in any of my work.

# What you may find on this page

I try to keep this page up to date with my most recent activity. It is mostly made to display my publications, current projects, teaching activities, and to share software.

# You should contact me if
* I can help you with anything related to building energy data analysis
* you can help me with math (my background is mostly thermodynamics)
* you have some data I can play with
* you like cartography, trail running or sound synthesis

# My CV in three steps
