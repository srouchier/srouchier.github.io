I teach heat transfer, HVAC systems, CAD etc. at the [Polytech](https://www.polytech.univ-smb.fr/) engineering school, Universit√© Savoie Mont-Blanc. I put up some online resources for students on these topics. I also wrote some tutorials on data analysis, mostly aimed for research. These resources are available on the following two pages.

# Tutorials on data analysis for building energy

The [InverseBuilding](https://srouchier.github.io/InverseBuilding/) page is a list of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate some simple data analysis problems and how to solve them. Examples include the inverse heat conduction problem and calibrating an RC model. I try to keep this page active by adding more content every so often.

# Heat transfer and HVAC systems

[ebeclim.org](http://ebeclim.org/) is a website where I post short videos about HVAC and heat transfer in buildings (mostly in French). It is originally meant as supplementary material for my students.

Here is one example about the prediction of air flow in buildings:
